# Arduboy Emulator Configuration
# 
# Path to the hex file (relative to workspace root)
# If this file is missing or hex_path is not specified, 
# the emulator will fallback to: .pio/build/arduboy/firmware.hex

hex_path=.pio/build/arduboy/firmware.hex

# Example configurations:
# 
# For custom build directory:
# hex_path=build/firmware.hex
#
# For different PlatformIO environment:
# hex_path=.pio/build/leonardo/firmware.hex
#
# For Arduino IDE builds:
# hex_path=build/arduino.avr.leonardo/firmware.hex
#
# For custom output location:
# hex_path=dist/my-game.hex
